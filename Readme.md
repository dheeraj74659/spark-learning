# 🚀 Spark Projects Hub

Welcome to the **Spark Projects Hub** — a collection of hands-on, beginner-to-intermediate level projects built using **Apache Spark** and **PySpark**. Each project explores a different real-world dataset and walks through a complete data pipeline: loading, cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and saving data — all using scalable Spark operations.

## 📚 What's Inside?

Each subdirectory in this repository is a standalone Spark project with its own dataset, notebook, and `README`.

| Project Name | Description | Dataset Source |

| [`nyc-taxi-analysis`](./nyc-taxi-analysis) | Analyze NYC taxi trips to find demand patterns, trip durations, and traffic inefficiencies | [NYC TLC Trip Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) |
| *(coming soon)* | More projects will be added here — stay tuned! | |
